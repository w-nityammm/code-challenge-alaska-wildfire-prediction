# **Code Challenge**  

This repository demonstrates my experience in **remote sensing and geospatial analytics**‚Äîas showcased in my research paper **"Predictive Modeling of Indian Agricultural Farms using Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analytics."**  

Here, I use **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** to process **multi-band satellite imagery**, compute **NDVI composites**, and perform a **basic land use classification** over an agricultural region (*using Karnal, Haryana as an example*). These techniques are directly applicable to challenges such as **wildfire risk prediction**, where identifying dry vegetation and different land cover types is crucial for fire risk assessment.

## **Project Files & Description**  

#### **NDVI Analysis `ndvi_analysis.js`**  
Computes **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)** to analyze vegetation health using **Sentinel-2** satellite imagery. NDVI is a crucial metric for assessing the dryness of vegetation, which can indicate potential wildfire risks.  

---

#### **Land Cover Classification `landcover_classification.js`**  
Performs **land use classification** using a **Random Forest classifier** to differentiate between **agriculture, non-agriculture, and other land types**. This technique can help in mapping fire-prone areas by identifying regions with dry fuel sources.

## **Usage**  

### **1: Use Provided Shareable Snapshots (auto-run disabled)**  
üîó **[NDVI Analysis - GEE Script](https://code.earthengine.google.com/2868992c976aae4fb4f764b6258e2d8b?noload=true)**
üîó **[Land Cover Classification - GEE Script](https://code.earthengine.google.com/e5d8d54067a3a6d6ce1dfd7b2b70b80c?noload=true)**  

Once opened, click **"Run"** to execute the script and view results.

### **2: Paste Scripts Directly in GEE**  
If you want to **customize the region, change color schemes, or adjust parameters** you can directly paste these scripts into GEE and modify them as needed. 

1Ô∏è. Go to **[Google Earth Engine Code Editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com/)**  
2Ô∏è. Create a new script.  
3Ô∏è. Copy and paste the contents of either `ndvi_analysis.js` or `landcover_classification.js`.  
4Ô∏è. Modify the **region coordinates**, color palette, or time range as needed.  
5Ô∏è. Click **"Run"** to visualize the results.
